This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router v6.  The catch-all route, intended to handle 404 scenarios, unexpectedly intercepts all other routes defined in the `Routes` component. This is because the `/*` route matches any path, including the specific paths defined above it.  The solution demonstrates a more correct way to handle this situation.
